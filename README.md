## 🚁 Drone Analysis Project | EDA • Cleaning • Insights

* A structured analysis of 576 drones to understand how price, range, battery type, weight, offers, and drone type influence performance. This project converts raw inconsistent data into clean, meaningful insights using Python and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## 🔍 What This Project Is About

* 🧹 Cleaning & transforming messy drone data into a usable format

* 📏 Converting units (kg → g, ft → m) for analysis accuracy

* 📊 Understanding drone pricing patterns & market ranges

* 🔋 Comparing battery types and their impact on ratings

* 🚁 Analyzing Mini vs Professional drones using statistical measures

* 📉 Finding relationships between Offer %, Price, Weight, Range & Rating

* 📈 Creating visuals for univariate, bivariate & multivariate insights

* 🧠 Identifying what actually influences drone performance

* 💾 Delivering a final cleaned dataset + PPT summary

## ✨ Key Features

* ✅ Complete EDA workflow

* ✅ Data Cleaning + Unit Conversion

* ✅ Statistical summary of drone types

* ✅ Battery comparison insights

* ✅ Correlation analysis

* ✅ Visual charts for all major findings

## 📝 Summary

* This project reveals that price does not guarantee performance:

* Most drones fall in the ₹1500–₹3000 range

* Lithium battery drones receive higher ratings

* Mini drones dominate but have shorter ranges

* Professional drones have nearly double the range of Minis

* Offer% and Price show a strong inverse relationship

* Weight does not strongly determine range or rating

* Overall, buyers should focus on battery type and range, not just price.
* Sellers should highlight range + battery quality instead of pricing alone.
